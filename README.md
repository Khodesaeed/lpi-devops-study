LPI DevOps study resources
==============

Here I place the resource links I found on LPI blog studying for [Exam 701: DevOps Tools Engineer](https://www.lpi.org/our-certifications/exam-701-objectives). There are checkboxes for each topic that I check when I finish covering that topic, also take notes and useful tips here under each topic.

Feel free to contribute and add resources.
